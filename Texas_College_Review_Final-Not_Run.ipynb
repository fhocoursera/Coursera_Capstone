    "# Texas College Review\n",
    "Author: Mr. Frederick Orndorff\n",
    "Date: January 26, 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Documentation:\n",
    "Most of the code below is from the Coursera labs within the __IBM Data Science__ Specialization.  I have modified the code to support my business problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "__Business Problem:__\n",
    "There are over 5,300 Colleges and Universities in the United States and over 450 of these colleges are in the state of Texas.  There are so many colleges in the Texas that a person could spend months (or even years) attempting to determine the best fit for a student -- or to determine which college is the best in Texas.  There are many personal opinions on which college ranks first, but can we use data to determine the best college in Texas?  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I will use public web data and the Foursquare API to provide a ranking for some Texas colleges.  This will be a data driven solution ot the business problem of too many colleges to determine the best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Stakeholders:__\n",
    "There are many stakeholders in this problem, including: students, parents (who might pay for the student to attend college), transfer students, as well as, the college administration and presidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "__Map Data:__\n",
    "I plan to create a choropeth map to provide a visual representation of crime and other data.  In order to adequately display the map I wanted to overlay the Texas counties on the state map.  The Texas state government provided the data used for the county overlays, located [at this link.](https://data.texas.gov/dataset/Texas-Counties-Centroid_Map/ups3-9e8m).  This dataset also provided the latitude and longitude coordinates needed to use the Foursquare API data.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Informational Datasets:___\n",
    "In addition to the county information I also found the following datasets that I will incooporate in our data driven solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [2018 Texas Crime Data](http://www.dps.texas.gov/administration/crime_records/pages/crimestatistics.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Texas Department of Public safety compiles data from state and local law enforcement agencies across the country, as well as the FBI. The Interstate Identification Index is a cooperative program between the FBI and the states to facilitate the exchange of information among those states and the FBI in order to reduce duplication of effort in records retention and demands accurate information for success. Crime data is focused on violent crimes, hate crimes, and assaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Texas State Expenditures by County](https://data.texas.gov/Government-and-Taxes/Texas-State-Expenditures-by-County/f2iw-dtqt)\n",
    "\n",
    "Texas State Expenditures by County shows where state dollars are spent. It lists state expenditures by agency and type of expenditure in each county. This data provides an overview of where the State is spending the local tax dollars for improvement(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [Mixed Beverage Sales](https://data.texas.gov/Government-and-Taxes/Mixed-Beverage-Gross-Receipts/naix-2893)\n",
    "\n",
    "This file contains a list of taxpayers required to report mixed beverage gross receipts tax reports under Texas law.  It provides total sales reported and taxes paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [List of Texas Colleges](http://www.txhighereddata.org/Interactive/Institutions.cfm)\n",
    "\n",
    "This database provides the list of Colleges, Universities, and trade schools available in the state of Texas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Application to the Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "__Assumptions___\n",
    "I will make the following assumptions for the stakeholders:\n",
    "1. Lower crime is better\n",
    "2. Higher state expenditures in the county is better\n",
    "3. Larger beverage sales is better (work hard - play harder!!)\n",
    "4. Larger number of Foursquare data (venues) in the area is better.\n",

Additionally, we had to make the county name lowercase to match the 'case' in other databases.\n",

This created the need to sum all the venues within each county - resulting in 254 unique 'total receipts', one for each county.  Secondly, the 'Location County' was a numerical entry - not text - therefore I needed to merge this dataframe using the county number.  Fortunately, the Texas County Map Data included the county number, so we can easly merge these two dataframes.  I orginally stripped the county number from the county database, but once I conducted some data analysis on the mixed beverage sales - I added the county number back so I could merege these databases."

    "* Not all programs are created equally.  Understanding the limitations of programs allows for a faster completion time and less stress.  During this project I determined Chrome is not adequate for choropleth maps with large json data files\n",
    "* Visualizations were key to better understanding the data\n",
    "* Austin or Travis County was first in alcohol sales, but none of the clusters focused on bars or other drinking establishments - this seems a little strange\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Data driven decisions provides another tool to decision making processes.  The vast amounts of data allows data scientists the ability to provide another viewpoint -- other than the opinion based decisions we make daily.  From this project we can see that stakeholders have many schools to choose from and using data provides the first step in focusing the options for decision makers.  This was a great learning experience and it showed me the importance of data in decision making."
